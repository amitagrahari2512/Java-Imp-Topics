/*

The version of collect( ) used by the previous example is quite convenient, and often
the one you want, but there is a second version that gives you more control over the
collection process. It is shown here:

	<R> R collect(Supplier<R> target, BiConsumer<R, ? super T> accumulator,BiConsumer <R, R> combiner)
	
Here, target specifies how the object that holds the result is created. For example, to use a
LinkedList as the result collection, you would specify its constructor. The accumulator
function adds an element to the result and combiner combines two partial results. Thus,
these functions work similarly to the way they do in reduce( ). For both, they must be
stateless and non-interfering. They must also be associative.

Note that the target parameter is of type Supplier. It is a functional interface declared in
java.util.function. It specifies only the get( ) method, which has no parameters and, in this
case, returns an object of type R. Thus, as it relates to collect( ), get( ) returns a reference to
a mutable storage object, such as a collection.

Note also that the types of accumulator and combiner are BiConsumer. This is a functional
interface defined in java.util.function. It specifies the abstract method accept( ) that is
shown here:

		void accept(T obj, U obj2)

This method performs some type of operation on obj and obj2. As it relates to accumulator,
obj specifies the target collection, and obj2 specifies the element to add to that collection. As
it relates to combiner, obj and obj2 specify two collections that will be combined.


::::Imp Point ::::
One last point: In the language of the stream API, the collect( ) method performs what
is called a mutable reduction. This is because the result of the reduction is a mutable (i.e.,
changeable) storage object, such as a collection
